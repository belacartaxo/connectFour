# Connect Four AI - Adversarial Search and Decision Trees

## Introduction
This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence 2024/2025** course assignment, focusing on adversarial search strategies and decision trees. The objective is to develop an AI capable of playing the game **Connect Four** against a human and another AI, using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and **ID3-based Decision Trees**.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a **7x6 grid**.
- Players take turns dropping a token into a column.
- The token falls to the lowest available row in that column.
- A player wins by connecting **four** tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game ends in a draw if the board is full with no winner.


## Game Modes
The implementation will support three game modes:
1. **Human vs. Human**
2. **Human vs. AI**
3. **AI vs. AI** (Two different algorithms)

The AI will use **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for adversarial search and **ID3 Decision Trees** for move prediction based on generated datasets.

## Project Structure and Code Documentation
- `Connect4.py`- Main interface to run the game. Handles user interaction and game flow.
- `Board.py`- Encapsulates all board mechanics for Connect Four.
- `MCTS.py`- Core implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.
- `Node.py`- Defines the structure for each node in the MCTS tree.

## Implementation Details
### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- The AI will use **Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)** for move evaluation.
- Different numbers of child nodes will be explored for performance analysis.
- The AI will simulate multiple future game states to determine the best move.

### Decision Trees (ID3 Algorithm)
- A decision tree will be trained to predict moves based on game states.
- The tree will be trained using a dataset generated by the MCTS algorithm.
- The ID3 algorithm will be implemented without external machine learning libraries.
- Numeric attributes will be discretized to optimize tree size and accuracy.

## Datasets
- **Dataset 1: Iris Dataset (for initial testing)**
  - Contains numerical attributes for classifying three types of iris plants.
  - Used to validate the decision tree implementation.
- **Dataset 2: Generated Connect Four Dataset**
  - Contains game states and corresponding best moves suggested by MCTS.
  - Used to train the final decision tree for move prediction.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Run the main game file (Connect4.py):
  ```bash
     python Connect4.py
  ```
