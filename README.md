# Connect Four AI - Adversarial Search and Decision Trees

## Introduction
This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence 2024/2025** course assignment, focusing on adversarial search strategies and decision trees. The objective is to develop an AI capable of playing the game **Connect Four** against a human and another AI, using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and **ID3-based Decision Trees**.

## Project Overview
The implementation will support three game modes:
1. **Human vs. Human**
2. **Human vs. AI**
3. **AI vs. AI** (Two different algorithms)

The AI will use **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for adversarial search and **ID3 Decision Trees** for move prediction based on generated datasets.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a **7x6 grid**.
- Players take turns dropping a token into a column.
- The token falls to the lowest available row in that column.
- A player wins by connecting **four** tokens in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game ends in a draw if the board is full with no winner.

## Implementation Details
### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- The AI will use **Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)** for move evaluation.
- Different numbers of child nodes will be explored for performance analysis.
- The AI will simulate multiple future game states to determine the best move.

### Decision Trees (ID3 Algorithm)
- A decision tree will be trained to predict moves based on game states.
- The tree will be trained using a dataset generated by the MCTS algorithm.
- The ID3 algorithm will be implemented without external machine learning libraries.
- Numeric attributes will be discretized to optimize tree size and accuracy.

## Datasets
- **Dataset 1: Iris Dataset (for initial testing)**
  - Contains numerical attributes for classifying three types of iris plants.
  - Used to validate the decision tree implementation.
- **Dataset 2: Generated Connect Four Dataset**
  - Contains game states and corresponding best moves suggested by MCTS.
  - Used to train the final decision tree for move prediction.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (only necessary libraries for data management and preprocessing are allowed).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the AI algorithms and visualize results.
4. Play the game in different modes by selecting the desired option.
